It is important to incorporate the variability present in human evaluation into HAS, since it helps capture diverse subjective interpretations and mitigate potential biases and over-representation.

Conditional softmax flow (S-CNF) is proposed to model the distribution of subjective human annotations, which leverages diverse human annotations via meta-learning. This enables the efficient generation of annotations that exhibit human variability for unlabelled input. In addition, a wide range of evaluation metrics are adopted to assess the capability and efficiency of HAS systems in predicting the aggregated behaviours of human annotators, matching the distribution of human annotations, and simulating the inter-annotator disagreements.

DiGS integrates recent developments in diffusion models, leveraging Gaussian convolution to create an auxiliary noisy distribution that bridges isolated modes in the original space and applying Gibbs sampling to alternately draw samples from both spaces. A novel Metropolis-within-Gibbs scheme is proposed to enhance mixing in the denoising sampling step. DiGS exhibits a better mixing property for sampling multi-modal distributions than state-of-the-art methods such as parallel tempering, attaining substantially improved performance across various tasks, including mixtures of Gaussians, Bayesian neural networks and molecular dynamics.

Human perception and behaviour during human evaluation exhibit inherent variability due to diverse cognitive processes and subjective interpretations, which should be taken into account in modelling to better mimic the way people perceive and interact with the world. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning framework that treats HAS as a zero-shot density estimation problem, which incorporates human variability and allows for the efficient generation of human-like annotations for unlabelled test inputs. Under this framework, we propose two new model classes, conditional integer flows and conditional softmax flows, to account for ordinal and categorical annotations, respectively.

In such cases, we show that identifiability is achievable even in the case of regression, extending prior work restricted to the single-task classification case. Furthermore, we show that the existence of a task distribution which defines a conditional prior over latent variables reduces the equivalence class for identifiability to permutations and scaling, a much stronger and more useful result. When we further assume a causal structure over these tasks, our approach enables simple maximum marginal likelihood optimization together with downstream applicability to causal representation learning.

In this work, we address this issue with a novel client subsampling scheme, where we restrict the number of clients allowed to communicate their updates back to the master node. In each communication round, all participating clients compute their updates, but only the ones with \"important\" updates communicate back to the master. We show that importance can be measured using only the norm of the update and give a formula for optimal client participation. This formula minimizes the distance between the full update, where all clients participate, and our limited update, where the number of participating clients is restricted. In addition, we provide a simple algorithm that approximates the optimal formula for client participation, which allows for secure aggregation and stateless clients, and thus does not compromise client privacy. We show both theoretically and empirically that for Distributed SGD (DSGD) and Federated Averaging (FedAvg), the performance of our approach can be close to full participation and superior to the baseline where participating clients are sampled uniformly. Moreover, our approach is orthogonal to and compatible with existing methods for reducing communication overhead, such as local methods and communication compression methods.","tags":[],"title":"Optimal Client Sampling for Federated Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Austin Tripp","Wenlin Chen","José Miguel Hernández-Lobato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651190400,"objectID":"7c674ec1dda2935eabce28cc88b5af57","permalink":"https://wenlin-chen.github.io/publication/tripp2022evaluation/","publishdate":"2022-04-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tripp2022evaluation/","section":"publication","summary":"De novo drug design has recently received increasing attention from the machine learning community. It is important that the field is aware of the actual goals and challenges of drug design and the roles that de novo molecule design algorithms could play in accelerating the process, so that algorithms can be evaluated in a way that reflects how they would be applied in real drug design scenarios. In this paper, we propose a framework for critically assessing the merits of benchmarks, and argue that most of the existing de novo drug design benchmark functions are either highly unrealistic or depend upon a surrogate model whose performance is not well characterized. In order for the field to achieve its long-term goals, we recommend that poor benchmarks (especially logP and QED) be deprecated in favour of better benchmarks.

We assume that the observed data was generated by a few latent factors, some of which are causally related to the target and others of which are spuriously correlated with the target and confounded by an environment variable. Our proposed method consists of three steps, which exploits the structure of the causal graph that describes the assumed underlying data generating process. In the first step, we recover the true data representation (i.e., the latent factors from which the observed data originated). We obtain novel identifiability theory, showing that the true data representation can be recovered up to simple transformations by a generalized version of identifiable variational auto-encoders. In the second step, we identify the causal latent factors of the target, for which we propose a practical causal inference scheme that employs (conditional) independence tests and causal discovery algorithms. Our method does not require having access to the true environment variable, which overcomes a major limitation of existing causal representation learning approaches in the literature. In the final step, we query latent points that correspond to data points with high target values by intervening upon the causal latent factors using standard latent space optimization techniques. We empirically evaluate and thoroughly analyze our method on three different tasks, including a chemical design task. We show that our method can successfully recover the true data representation in the finite data regime and correctly identify the causal latent factors of the target, which results in state-of-the-art performance for black-box optimization.","tags":[],"title":"Causal Representation Learning for Latent Space Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Webb","Charles Reynolds","Wenlin Chen","Henry Reeve","Dan Iliescu","Mikel Luján","Gavin Brown"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600041600,"objectID":"73540bab56f2b0d108a710976f7b0dcb","permalink":"https://wenlin-chen.github.io/publication/webb2020ensemble/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/webb2020ensemble/","section":"publication","summary":"End-to-End training (E2E) is becoming more and more popular to train complex Deep Network architectures.

Our strategy is to blend the gradient smoothly in between two extremes: from independent training of the networks, up to to full E2E training. We find clear failure cases, where overparameterized models cannot be trained E2E. A surprising result is that the optimum can sometimes lie in between the two, neither an ensemble or an E2E system.
