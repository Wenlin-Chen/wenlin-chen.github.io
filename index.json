It is important that the field is aware of the actual goals and challenges of drug design and the roles that de novo molecule design algorithms could play in accelerating the process, so that algorithms can be evaluated in a way that reflects how they would be applied in real drug design scenarios. In this paper, we propose a framework for critically assessing the merits of benchmarks, and argue that most of the existing de novo drug design benchmark functions are either highly unrealistic or depend upon a surrogate model whose performance is not well characterized. In order for the field to achieve its long-term goals, we recommend that poor benchmarks (especially logP and QED) be deprecated in favour of better benchmarks. We hope that our proposed framework can play a part in developing new de novo drug design benchmarks that are more realistic and ideally incorporate the intrinsic goals of drug design.","tags":[],"title":"An Evaluation Framework for the Objective Functions of De Novo Drug Design Benchmarks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenlin Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629331200,"objectID":"12bedca3d469d735925baf247e9638c5","permalink":"https://wenlin-chen.github.io/publication/chen2021causal/","publishdate":"2021-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen2021causal/","section":"publication","summary":"In this thesis, we study causal representation learning for latent space optimization, which allows for robust and efficient generation of novel synthetic data with maximal target value.  We assume that the observed data was generated by a few latent factors, some of which are causally related to the target and others of which are spuriously correlated with the target and confounded by an environment variable. Our proposed method consists of three steps, which exploits the structure of the causal graph that describes the assumed underlying data generating process. In the first step, we recover the true data representation (i.e., the latent factors from which the observed data originated). We obtain novel identifiability theory, showing that the true data representation can be recovered up to simple transformations by a generalized version of identifiable variational auto-encoders. In the second step, we identify the causal latent factors of the target, for which we propose a practical causal inference scheme that employs (conditional) independence tests and causal discovery algorithms. Our method does not require having access to the true environment variable, which overcomes a major limitation of existing causal representation learning approaches in the literature. In the final step, we query latent points that correspond to data points with high target values by intervening upon the causal latent factors using standard latent space optimization techniques. We empirically evaluate and thoroughly analyze our method on three different tasks, including a chemical design task. We show that our method can successfully recover the true data representation in the finite data regime and correctly identify the causal latent factors of the target, which results in state-of-the-art performance for black-box optimization.","tags":[],"title":"Causal Representation Learning for Latent Space Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenlin Chen","Samuel Horváth","Peter Richtárik"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603670400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603670400,"objectID":"9b46c19f513bcfc9944742d03bf99dce","permalink":"https://wenlin-chen.github.io/publication/chen2020optimal/","publishdate":"2020-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen2020optimal/","section":"publication","summary":"It is well understood that client-master communication can be a primary bottleneck in Federated Learning. In this work, we address this issue with a novel client subsampling scheme, where we restrict the number of clients allowed to communicate their updates back to the master node. In each communication round, all participating clients compute their updates, but only the ones with \"important\" updates communicate back to the master. We show that importance can be measured using only the norm of the update and give a formula for optimal client participation. This formula minimizes the distance between the full update, where all clients participate, and our limited update, where the number of participating clients is restricted. In addition, we provide a simple algorithm that approximates the optimal formula for client participation, which only requires secure aggregation and thus does not compromise client privacy. We show both theoretically and empirically that for Distributed SGD (DSGD) and Federated Averaging (FedAvg), the performance of our approach can be close to full participation and superior to the baseline where participating clients are sampled uniformly. Moreover, our approach is orthogonal to and compatible with existing methods for reducing communication overhead, such as local methods and communication compression methods.","tags":[],"title":"Optimal Client Sampling for Federated Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Webb","Charles Reynolds","Wenlin Chen","Henry Reeve","Dan Iliescu","Mikel Luján","Gavin Brown"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600041600,"objectID":"73540bab56f2b0d108a710976f7b0dcb","permalink":"https://wenlin-chen.github.io/publication/webb2020ensemble/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/webb2020ensemble/","section":"publication","summary":"End-to-End training (E2E) is becoming more and more popular to train complex Deep Network architectures. An interesting question is whether this trend will continue—are there any clear failure cases for E2E training? We study this question in depth, for the specific case of E2E training an ensemble of networks. Our strategy is to blend the gradient smoothly in between two extremes: from independent training of the networks, up to to full E2E training. We find clear failure cases, where overparameterized models cannot be trained E2E. A surprising result is that the optimum can sometimes lie in between the two, neither an ensemble or an E2E system. The work also uncovers links to Dropout, and raises questions around the nature of ensemble diversity and multi-branch networks.","tags":[],"title":"To Ensemble or Not Ensemble: When Does End-to-End Training Fail?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://wenlin-chen.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
