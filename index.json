Goal: Draw new samples from $p_D(x)$. Evaluate the probability of a given sample $x$ under $p_D(x)$. Approach: model $p_D(x)$ with a parametric model $p_{\\theta}(x)$ (e.g., parameterized by a neural network) and optimize $\\theta$ such that $p_{\\theta}(x)\\approx p_D(x)$. Energy-based Models Energy-based Models (EBMs) parameterize an energy function $E_{\\theta}(x)\\geq0$ with parameters $\\theta$: $$p_{\\theta}(x)=\\frac{\\exp(-E_{\\theta}(x))}{Z_{\\theta}}.$$ the partition function/normalizing constant: $$Z_{\\theta}=\\int \\exp(-E_{\\theta}(x)) dx,$$ analytically intractable, independent of the input $x$ but dependent on the model parameters $\\theta$.

Score-based models (SBMs) directly parameterize the score function $s_{\\theta}(x)\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$. $s_{\\theta}(x)$ may not be a conservative vector field (i.e., the gradient of something), but usually not a problem in practice. More efficient than EBM which needs to differentiate the energy to get the score. U-Net is a common model choice for image generation problems. Langevin Dynamics MCMC using score functions: $$x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}+\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2}\\nabla_x\\log p_{\\theta}(x)+\\epsilon z^{(k)},\\quad k=0,1,\\cdots,K,$$ or, equivalently, $$x^{(k+1)}=x^{(k)}+\\epsilon\\nabla_x\\log p_{\\theta}(x)+\\sqrt{2\\epsilon} z^{(k)},\\quad k=0,1,\\cdots,K,$$ where $\\nabla_x\\log p_{\\theta}(x)=-\\nabla_x E_{\\theta}(x)$ for EBMs and $\\nabla_x\\log p_{\\theta}(x)=s_{\\theta}(x)$ for SBMs. $x^{(0)}$ starts from some simple prior distribution (e.g., standard Gaussian), $z^{(k)}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I)$ are independent Gaussian noises, $x^{(k)}\\sim p_{\\theta}(x)$ as $k\\to\\infty$ and $\\epsilon\\to 0$ under regularity conditions. If $p_{\\theta}(x)\\approx p_D(x)$ after learning, then this allows us to draw samples from $p_D(x)$. Score Matching Score matching (SM) by minimizing the Fisher divergence: $$\\min_{\\theta}~D_F[p_D(x)||p_{\\theta}(x)]=\\mathbb{E}{p_D(x)}\\left[\\frac{1}{2} \\Vert \\nabla_x \\log p_D(x) - s{\\theta}(x)\\Vert^2\\right],$$ intractable due to the unknown the data score $\\nabla_x \\log p_D(x)$, only works for non-degenerate (i.e., full support, $\\mathcal{X}=\\mathbb{R}^d$) $p_D(x)$: $$s_{\\theta}(x)=\\nabla_x \\log p_D(x),~\\forall x\\quad\\iff\\quad p_{\\theta}=p_{D}.$$ A tractable score matching objective: $$D_F[p_D(x)||p_{\\theta}(x)]=\\mathbb{E}{p_D(x)}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\Vert s{\\theta}(x)\\Vert^2 + \\text{Tr}(J_x s_{\\theta}(x))\\right]+\\text{const.}$$ Derived by integration by parts under regularity conditions. No unknown data score term. The trace of the Jacobian of the score function $\\text{Tr}(J_x s_{\\theta}(x))$ takes $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ time to compute, which is still computationally expensive. Denoising Score Matching (DSM) Perturbe $p_D(x)$ with a small noise: $$\\tilde{x}=x+\\sigma z,\\quad z\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,I),$$ or, equivalently, $$p_{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x})=\\int q_{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x}|x)p_D(x)dx,\\quad\\text{where } q_{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x}|x)=\\mathcal{N}(\\tilde{x}|x,\\sigma^2I).$$ Match the score of the perturbed data distribution $p_{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x})$: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\min_{\\theta}~D_F[p_{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x})||p_{\\theta}(\\tilde{x})] \u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E}{p{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x})}\\left[\\frac{1}{2} \\Vert \\nabla_{\\tilde{x}} \\log p_{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x}) - s_{\\theta}(\\tilde{x})\\Vert^2\\right] \\ \u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E}{q{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x}|x)p_D(x)}\\left[\\frac{1}{2} \\Vert \\nabla_{\\tilde{x}} \\log q_{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x}|x) - s_{\\theta}(\\tilde{x})\\Vert^2\\right] \\ \u0026amp;=\\mathbb{E}{\\mathcal{N}(z|0,I)p_D(x)}\\left[\\frac{1}{2} \\left\\Vert \\frac{z}{\\sigma} + s{\\theta}(x+\\sigma z)\\right\\Vert^2\\right]. \\end{aligned} $$ No unknown data score term. $p_{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x})$ is always non-degenerate regardless of the support of $p_D(x)$, since it is obtained by convolving $p_D(x)$ with (full support) Gaussian noise $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2I)$. $\\sigma$ needs to be close to zero: $$s_{\\theta}(\\tilde{x})=\\nabla_{\\tilde{x}} \\log p_{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x}),~\\forall \\tilde{x}\\quad\\iff\\quad p_{\\theta}=p_{\\sigma}\\approx p_D.$$ $\\sigma$ cannot be too small for the purpose of numerical stability (e.g., the DSM objective has a a term $z/\\sigma$). Pitfalls of DSM: $s_{\\theta}(x)$ is inaccurate in low density regions of $p_D(x)$ since very few or no samples are available for the model to train on. When drawing new samples via Langevin dynamics, the initial point $x^{(0)}$ is very likely to be in a low density region in high dimensions. Prevents us from moving to high density regions (i.e., generating high quality samples) that are representative of $p_D(x)$. Need to use large $\\sigma$ to populate low density regions, but there is a trade-off: $\\sigma$ should be sufficiently large so that $p_{\\sigma}(\\tilde{x})$ covers low density regions. Remember that $\\sigma$ should also be sufficiently small so that $p_{\\sigma}\\approx p_D$.

Human perception and behaviour during human evaluation exhibit inherent variability due to diverse cognitive processes and subjective interpretations, which should be taken into account in modelling to better mimic the way people perceive and interact with the world. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning framework that treats HAS as a zero-shot density estimation problem, which incorporates human variability and allows for the efficient generation of human-like annotations for unlabelled test inputs. Under this framework, we propose two new model classes, conditional integer flows and conditional softmax flows, to account for ordinal and categorical annotations, respectively. The proposed method is evaluated on three real-world human evaluation tasks and shows superior capability and efficiency to predict the aggregated behaviours of human annotators, match the distribution of human annotations, and simulate the inter-annotator disagreements.","tags":[],"title":"It HAS to be Subjective: Human Annotator Simulation via Zero-shot Density Estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenlin Chen","Julien Horwood","Juyeon Heo","José Miguel Hernández-Lobato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1687824000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687824000,"objectID":"6039f5f4bbc26f58c353b25a8afbb2f9","permalink":"https://wenlin-chen.github.io/publication/chen2023leveraging/","publishdate":"2023-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen2023leveraging/","section":"publication","summary":"This work extends the theory of identifiability in supervised learning by considering the consequences of having access to a distribution of tasks.

In this work, we address this issue with a novel client subsampling scheme, where we restrict the number of clients allowed to communicate their updates back to the master node. In each communication round, all participating clients compute their updates, but only the ones with \"important\" updates communicate back to the master. We show that importance can be measured using only the norm of the update and give a formula for optimal client participation. This formula minimizes the distance between the full update, where all clients participate, and our limited update, where the number of participating clients is restricted. In addition, we provide a simple algorithm that approximates the optimal formula for client participation, which allows for secure aggregation and stateless clients, and thus does not compromise client privacy. We show both theoretically and empirically that for Distributed SGD (DSGD) and Federated Averaging (FedAvg), the performance of our approach can be close to full participation and superior to the baseline where participating clients are sampled uniformly.

In this paper, we propose a framework for critically assessing the merits of benchmarks, and argue that most of the existing de novo drug design benchmark functions are either highly unrealistic or depend upon a surrogate model whose performance is not well characterized.

We assume that the observed data was generated by a few latent factors, some of which are causally related to the target and others of which are spuriously correlated with the target and confounded by an environment variable. Our proposed method consists of three steps, which exploits the structure of the causal graph that describes the assumed underlying data generating process. In the first step, we recover the true data representation (i.e., the latent factors from which the observed data originated). We obtain novel identifiability theory, showing that the true data representation can be recovered up to simple transformations by a generalized version of identifiable variational auto-encoders. In the second step, we identify the causal latent factors of the target, for which we propose a practical causal inference scheme that employs (conditional) independence tests and causal discovery algorithms. Our method does not require having access to the true environment variable, which overcomes a major limitation of existing causal representation learning approaches in the literature. In the final step, we query latent points that correspond to data points with high target values by intervening upon the causal latent factors using standard latent space optimization techniques. We empirically evaluate and thoroughly analyze our method on three different tasks, including a chemical design task. We show that our method can successfully recover the true data representation in the finite data regime and correctly identify the causal latent factors of the target, which results in state-of-the-art performance for black-box optimization.","tags":[],"title":"Causal Representation Learning for Latent Space Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Webb","Charles Reynolds","Wenlin Chen","Henry Reeve","Dan Iliescu","Mikel Luján","Gavin Brown"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600041600,"objectID":"73540bab56f2b0d108a710976f7b0dcb","permalink":"https://wenlin-chen.github.io/publication/webb2020ensemble/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/webb2020ensemble/","section":"publication","summary":"End-to-End training (E2E) is becoming more and more popular to train complex Deep Network architectures.
