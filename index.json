Traditional training methods often rely on the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence due to its tractability. However, the mode-seeking behavior of reverse KL hinders effective approximation of multi-modal target distributions. To address this, we propose to minimize the reverse KL along diffusion trajectories of both model and target densities. We refer to this objective as the reverse diffusive KL divergence, which allows the model to capture multiple modes. Leveraging this objective, we train neural samplers that can efficiently generate samples from the target distribution in one step. We demonstrate that our method enhances sampling performance across various Boltzmann distributions, including both synthetic multi-modal densities and n-body particle systems.","tags":[],"title":"Training Neural Samplers with Reverse Diffusive KL Divergence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenlin Chen","Hong Ge"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1733788800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733788800,"objectID":"8f81276bd0520086c1943085817e4c7a","permalink":"https://wenlin-chen.github.io/publication/chen2024neural/","publishdate":"2023-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen2024neural/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a novel approach for analyzing the training dynamics of ReLU networks by examining the characteristic activation boundaries of individual ReLU neurons.

In contrast, standard HVAEs often produce images of inferior quality compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the success of diffusion models can be partly attributed to the additional self-supervision information for their intermediate latent states provided by corrupted images, which along with the original image form a pseudo video. Based on this hypothesis, we explore the possibility of improving other types of generative models with such pseudo videos. Specifically, we first extend a given image generative model to their video generative model counterpart, and then train the video generative model on pseudo videos constructed by applying data augmentation to the original images. Furthermore, we analyze the potential issues of first-order Markov data augmentation methods, which are typically used in diffusion models, and propose to use more expressive data augmentation to construct more useful information in pseudo videos. Our empirical results on the CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets demonstrate that improved image generation quality can be achieved with additional self-supervised information from pseudo videos.","tags":[],"title":"Your Image is Secretly the Last Frame of a Pseudo Video","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenlin Chen","Julien Horwood","Juyeon Heo","José Miguel Hernández-Lobato"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1724457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1724457600,"objectID":"51bd119fc40a9367b1d4735678de0282","permalink":"https://wenlin-chen.github.io/publication/chen2024leveraging/","publishdate":"2023-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen2024leveraging/","section":"publication","summary":"This work extends the theory of identifiability in supervised learning by considering the consequences of having access to a distribution of tasks. In such cases, we show that linear identifiability is achievable in the general multi-task regression setting. Furthermore, we show that the existence of a task distribution which defines a conditional prior over latent factors reduces the equivalence class for identifiability to permutations and scaling of the true latent factors, a stronger and more useful result than linear identifiability. Crucially, when we further assume a causal structure over these tasks, our approach enables simple maximum marginal likelihood optimization, and suggests potential downstream applications to causal representation learning. Empirically, we find that this straightforward optimization procedure enables our model to outperform more general unsupervised models in recovering canonical representations for both synthetic data and real-world molecular data.","tags":[],"title":"Leveraging Task Structures for Improved Identifiability in Neural Network Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wen Wu","Wenlin Chen","Chao Zhang","Philip C.

In this work, we address this issue with a novel client subsampling scheme, where we restrict the number of clients allowed to communicate their updates back to the master node. In each communication round, all participating clients compute their updates, but only the ones with \"important\" updates communicate back to the master. We show that importance can be measured using only the norm of the update and give a formula for optimal client participation. This formula minimizes the distance between the full update, where all clients participate, and our limited update, where the number of participating clients is restricted. In addition, we provide a simple algorithm that approximates the optimal formula for client participation, which allows for secure aggregation and stateless clients, and thus does not compromise client privacy. We show both theoretically and empirically that for Distributed SGD (DSGD) and Federated Averaging (FedAvg), the performance of our approach can be close to full participation and superior to the baseline where participating clients are sampled uniformly.

We assume that the observed data was generated by a few latent factors, some of which are causally related to the target and others of which are spuriously correlated with the target and confounded by an environment variable. Our proposed method consists of three steps, which exploits the structure of the causal graph that describes the assumed underlying data generating process. In the first step, we recover the true data representation (i.e., the latent factors from which the observed data originated). We obtain novel identifiability theory, showing that the true data representation can be recovered up to simple transformations by a generalized version of identifiable variational auto-encoders. In the second step, we identify the causal latent factors of the target, for which we propose a practical causal inference scheme that employs (conditional) independence tests and causal discovery algorithms. Our method does not require having access to the true environment variable, which overcomes a major limitation of existing causal representation learning approaches in the literature. In the final step, we query latent points that correspond to data points with high target values by intervening upon the causal latent factors using standard latent space optimization techniques. We empirically evaluate and thoroughly analyze our method on three different tasks, including a chemical design task. We show that our method can successfully recover the true data representation in the finite data regime and correctly identify the causal latent factors of the target, which results in state-of-the-art performance for black-box optimization.","tags":[],"title":"Causal Representation Learning for Latent Space Optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Webb","Charles Reynolds","Wenlin Chen","Henry Reeve","Dan Iliescu","Mikel Luján","Gavin Brown"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600041600,"objectID":"73540bab56f2b0d108a710976f7b0dcb","permalink":"https://wenlin-chen.github.io/publication/webb2020ensemble/","publishdate":"2020-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/webb2020ensemble/","section":"publication","summary":"End-to-End training (E2E) is becoming more and more popular to train complex Deep Network architectures.
